I see the influx of first-generation students to University campuses as one of the most exciting and urgent pedagogical challenges I’ve faced in recent years. According to the National center for Education Statistics, around 40% of students currently enrolled inhigher education are the first generation of their family to attend college.The resources that first-generation students bring to college are often undervalued by academic programs in the United States, conversely, the economic andcultural norms of middle- and upper-class students make it easier for them to succeed. Confronting the uncertainties of a precarious job market along with the social challenges highlighted by the recent focus on campus sexual assault and the systemic racism brought to light by the Black Lives Matter movement, we must ask how much a traditional British Literature course canspeak to their concerns. Too many times, I have seen Latinx, Japanese, and Indian students struggle through 1,000 pages of British Victorian prose by Charles Dickens only to fail to see themselves in any of his characters. 

Contemporary students are passionate about social change, and they enthusiastically undertake difficult assignments and wrestle with complex ideas if they understand their relevance. On the other hand, they also have no patience for professors who don’t listen to them and don’t careabout their lives. When I decided to completely overhaul my DTC 375 and DTC 101courses during the Fall of 2016, I took lessons from Senior Exit Surveys Iconducted as “Assessment Coordinator” for the DTC program. Many students wantedmore hands-on experiences and less reading. My resulting DTC 375 course on “Media Histories” included readings, but I decided that — unlike my literature courses— DTC courses should not be primarily focused on the act of reading text. Ialso redesigned the syllabus using recommendations from Anne-Marie Womack’s website *[The Accessible Syllabus](https://accessiblesyllabus.tulane.edu/)*, which urges professors to use images to compliment the written communication ofcourse objectives; and to establish a rhetoric of inclusion, cooperation, andinvitation over a style of paternalistic commands or contractual detail. Theresult was one of the most successful courses I’ve ever taught during my careeras a teacher in higher education.
